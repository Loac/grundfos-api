# Documentation for Grundfos API

Download the Swagger [distribution](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist),
unpack it, and replace the `swagger-initializer.js` file located in it with the one provided here.
Additionally, place the documentation (v1, v2, v3) folders into the Swagger directory.
After completing these steps, it is necessary to host Swagger on any web-server,
as it will not work when launched directly from the directory."
